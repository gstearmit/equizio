# EQUIZIO - AI based quiz management system

## Introduction

EQUIZIO – An artificial intelligence based desktop quiz management system. We used the term “artificial intelligence” here as the system generates questions intelligently. 

The system generates the a new question of a quiz by depending on the result of the question last answered and for the same quiz of a subject it generates different questions for different students. The questions vary student to student for the same quiz while they are sitting in the quiz at the same time. 

Teachers can use the EQUIZIO for evaluating students effectively, efficiently and perfectly.
